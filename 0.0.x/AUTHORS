Thanks to Benjamin Lau, Alexander Larsson, Bryan Forbes, and 
Murray Cumming for sharing their knowledge, mostly through the
gtkmm and gnome-vfs mailing lists.

Darimasen may or may not have code from Regexxer
(http://regexxer.sourceforge.net/) - their autogen.sh was consuted,
at least. ^_^

Portions of the code were generated by glademm.

Portions of the code were stolen directly from the glibmm examples,
 and brutalized until they did our bidding.
