Recomended programming standards:
 (or, things should be changed to comply with these if they don't already)

Class constructors come first.
Then private variables
Then private functions, in alpebetical order
Then public functions
There should be no public variables
  - all should have "get_" and "set_" properties instead.


functions should be seperated by
/**********************/
so they can be easily distinguished in code.


supplimental.* : functions not easily identified with an existing class.
iconmodes.cpp.* : all file (non directory) handling.
damenu.* ": all directory handling with the normal system. (not the tree)
firsttime.* : prompts in the first run of darimasen. (currently if ROX has never been run)
optionsManager.* : Parsing and maintaining options outside program session.
main.* : command line parsing, systems checks, program init.
darimasen.* : Managing GUI elements visable in main window.
