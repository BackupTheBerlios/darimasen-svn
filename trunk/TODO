version 0.0.8

Must do:

evaluate the " Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed" messages
Full Folder & Icon context menus.
Keyboard navigation of menus (Alt+1 opens root menu, Alt+2 opens first child, etc)

Move, copy, delete of files needs more checking

move, copy, delete of folder
move, copy of folder contents

Traditional List and detail views


Would like to do:

limiting DaMenu expansion (preserve window width for long paths) - by shortening menu names
AppDir Support
Create new folder
Ron <Rds> mentioned that Rox will be moving for ~/Choices to ~/.choices - should probably support that, or check both locations
use existing thumbnails / create new thumbnails (a la ROX)


version 0.0.9
-----------------------------------------------

Optional Directory tree, updated as needed

Package as appdir?

@commit 11 -- With the ROX / Gnome-vfsmm work done, most of Ron's <Rds> code is gone. This would include the AppDir test. However, appdirs would never end up showing up in the main window, so this is not a huge loss as of yet. His test was for AppRun within the directory - it would require testing for that file's existance, then notifying that it is an executable and needs a unique icon.
