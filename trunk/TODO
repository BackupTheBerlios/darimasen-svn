OK, I've separated the sidecon tables from the event boxes that actually activate them.

This allows for generic menus.

This also breaks a lot of other things. ^_^; However, it should also allow for a significant speedup of window resize, adding these separated event boxes to an array
will a allow for a simple heightChange function to redistribute them on a table.





--version 0.0.6

   limit DaMenu expansion. (preserve window width for long paths)
   Hung up on the fact that new width is calculated *after*
   The signal is complete, need a way to move up size calculation,
   preferably without displaying on screen. There's an enum for
   Immediate redraw. Use it on the toolbar?
   
   "If you want to force an area of a window to be redrawn,
   use gdk_window_invalidate_rect() or gdk_window_invalidate_region().
   To cause the redraw to be done immediately, follow that call with
   a call to gdk_window_process_updates()."
   
   --! Actually, it seems that the way this might be done is in
       the on_configure_event, which  has immediate sizes. 


Gdk::VISIBILITY_NOTIFY_MASK has somthing to do with progressive menu building.
   
   
   Generic detail view (Name, Size, Permissions, etc.)

   De-activate menu items so signals can get through to event boxes.
   
   --! this requires Gtk::Menu::attach() and a lot of menuitems.




--version 0.0.7++ and onwards

   Icon Context menus that do somthing



 The Generated becomes a class that returns a Gtk::Menubar&
 Makefiles XOR ./autogen.sh
 ROX or Gnome-compatible mimetypes and execution, some standard
 standard tree navigation
 all the folder context menus...

 CVS @ sf, other repository?

3. window_layout.cpp
   C:\Documents and Settings\-----------\My Documents\Projects\Darimasen-0.0.4\window_layout.o
   (.text$_ZN3Gtk14TreeViewColumnC1IN4Glib7ustringEEERKS3_RKNS_15TreeModelColumnIT_EE+0x116)
   variable 'vtable for Gtk::TreeViewColumn' can't be auto-imported.
   Please read the documentation for ld's --enable-auto-import for details.
   
   A: This seems to be a Win32-specific error, looking at alternate means.
      Using table instead, although this would probably be more easily sorted.


4. Is there a generic empty container to put things in, to switch the contents
   between the file listing and Find window?

   A: it seems an HBox could do it, switching between showing the different
      windows. Simply don't show() it.
      
6. How would you determine if an toolbox overflow menu is displayed?
  (not just available, but currently in use)

   A: There are ways to do it with get_allocation(), but the redraw point needs to
      be somehow moved up.
