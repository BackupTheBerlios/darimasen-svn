version 0.0.7: Embetterment by Tab

Must address:

getting submenus to popup in the correct position
resetting menus where subsubdirs have been used
reduce iconmodes' ustring passing by using history.
"begining of history" segfault.



Would like to address:

limiting DaMenu expansion (preserve window width for long paths) - by shortening menu names

Folder context menus.

version 0.0.8 and onwards

Detail view, how to handle icon mode switching now
Ron <Rds> mentioned that Rox will be moving for ~/Choices to ~/.choices - should probably support that, or check both locations.

--

int * MenuWidths; is for saving the lengths of the strings, to determine which should be shortened first. I think for 0.0.6 taht just replacing the title with single character should be good enough. 

the other method - make another menu wih dirs a menus - well, am I going to do it? I dunno.

--

   
   
   Generic detail view (Name, Size, Permissions, etc.) should be easy now with gnome_vfsmm; however, sorting them by this info is a bit more of a challenge. A ListView would probably be much better for this. This makes for some hey-my-scalp-is-bleeding type head-scratching problems, so a dummy label is in place for now.

mime-type dependant icons, a la ROX.

---

@commit 11 -- With the ROX / Gnome-vfsmm work done, most of Ron's <Rds> code is gone. This would include the AppDir test. However, appdirs would never end up showing up in the main window, so this is not a huge loss as of yet. His test was for AppRun within the directory - it would require testing for that file's existance, then notifying that it is an executable and needs a unique icon.
