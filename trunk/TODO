Ron <Rds> mentioned that Rox will be moving for ~/Choices to ~/.choices - should probably support that, or check both locations.

limit DaMenu expansion. (preserve window width for long paths)

There are two ways to do the actual shrinkage - shorten the names up top, or make another menu wih dirs a menus.

   Generic detail view (Name, Size, Permissions, etc.) should be easy now with gnome_vfsmm; however, sorting them by this info is a bit more of a challenge. A ListView would probably be much better for this. This makes for some hey-my-scalp-is-bleeding type head-scratching problems, so a dummy label is in place for now.

mime-type dependant icons, a la ROX.

@commit 11 -- With the ROX / Gnome-vfsmm work done, most of Ron's <Rds> code is gone. This would include the AppDir test. However, appdirs would never end up showing up in the main window, so this is not a huge loss as of yet. His test was for AppRun within the directory - it would require testing for that file's existance, then notifying that it is an executable and needs a unique icon.
