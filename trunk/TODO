version 0.0.8

Must do:

add a routine to update tab numbers when tabs get deleted.

evaluate the " Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_event: assertion `WIDGET_REALIZED_FOR_EVENT (widget, event)' failed" messages
Full Folder context menu.
Keyboard navigation of menus (Alt+1 opens root menu, Alt+2 opens first child, etc)

Move, copy, delete of files needs more checking (or at least feedback)

move, copy, delete of folder
move, copy of folder contents

detail view


Would like to do:

limiting DaMenu expansion (preserve window width for long paths) - by shortening menu names
Create new folder
use existing thumbnails / create new thumbnails (a la ROX)
files in APPDIR root folder are not appdirs - check if file name is in path...

Optional Directory tree, updated as needed

Package as appdir?

Drag and drop - into menu, between tabs, copy/paste/link popup, multiple selection

Consider DnD holding box - a "Drop stack".
