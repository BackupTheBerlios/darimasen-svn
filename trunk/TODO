version 0.0.8

Must do:

Move, copy, delete of files needs more checking (or at least feedback)
move, copy, delete of folder
move, copy of folder contents
detail view


Would like to do:

Keyboard navigation of menus (Alt+1 opens root menu, Alt+2 opens first child, etc)
set unreadable folders insensitive, etc.
Create new folder


nicities:
When deleting a file (or any other operation that leaves you in the same dir
 in the current window), keep the scrolled position in the same place if possible.
limiting DaMenu expansion (preserve window width for long paths) - by shortening menu names
use existing thumbnails / create new thumbnails (a la ROX)
