Is given a path to build off of.

It puts this into an array of strings, starting with root/home and ending
with the current directory.

Each memeber of the array gets a menu, showing the sibling directories and 
how many subdirectories each of them have. The directory itself is at the top of
 the list, and not present in its normal space below.

The first menu is always ~/ or / ,and holds home, root, and the location menu.
 these locations are gotten from the preferences in darimasen.

THe last menu is in the form #>, where the # is the number of subdirectories
 of the current dir, and the menu has those subdirectories and their counts.
