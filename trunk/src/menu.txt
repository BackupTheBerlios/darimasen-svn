Is given a path to build off of.

It puts this into an array of strings, starting with root/home and ending
with the current directory.

Each member of the array gets a menu, showing the sibling directories and 
how many subdirectories each of them have. The directory itself is at the top of
 the list, and not present in its normal space below.

The first menu is always ~/ or / ,and holds home, root, and the location menu.
 these locations are gotten from the preferences in darimasen.

THe last menu is in the form #>, where the # is the number of subdirectories
 of the current dir, and the menu has those subdirectories and their counts. 


The difference between this and the previous version is that submenus will be build only in an on-demand basis. THe whole file system will not need to be scanned to get a menu; only the current folder, to count the number of subdirectories. 

Strictly speaking, this is not just the menu to manage, but the whole top toolbar.
