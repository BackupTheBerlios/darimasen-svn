darimasen.cs

The main window. Arranges everything.

Listens for signals from tabs that a tab has been switched, and:
  sets hidden checkbox
  makes new menu
  orders new back button 
  

makes new tabs in begining, setting format from preferences

Also has a preferences for locations menu, which is stored.

That checkbox is in an options menu, which has regular stuff like 'quit' in it. 
then the darimasen menu,
then the back button/menu,
then the new tab button,
then the icon-type switch, which will send a signal to tabs,
then a directory tree toggle if I get to it.
