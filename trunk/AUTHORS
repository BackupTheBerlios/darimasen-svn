Thanks to Benjamin Lau, Alexander Larsson, Bryan Forbes, and Murray Cumming for sharing their knowledge, mostly through the gtkmm and gnome-vfs mailing lists.

Darimasen may or may not have code from Regexxer (http://regexxer.sourceforge.net/) - their autogen.sh was consuted, at least. ^_^

Some code is from glademm.
