Darimasen is based on one main idea: never say 'folder'; at least,
not if you can't actually hold a folder. 

Programming-wise, this means that there are not only folder icons,
but you simply can't navigate the directory structure via the
file view. There is (or will be) a directory tree, but even this is
not displayed by default.

Darimasen has menu-based directory navigation. It might be remind
you of the Gnome 2.8 file chooser's buttons, or of the website
navigation technique - but it has two major differences:

1. They are all menus,

2. Those menus show sibling directories, not child directories.

For example, say you are in your home directory, which 
has three subdirectories; work/, play/, and hack/. Two menus would be
generated; the first, "~/", would switch you between home and
other important areas, like your mounted drives. THe second, in this case,
would be a "3>>"; the current folder has three subdirectories,
and you access them through that menu. And look! "hack/" has a "2"
beside it, meaning it has two subdirectories itself. So clicking
"hack/", the menus change.


~/  hack/  2>>


The "~/" menu is the same, but the new "hack/" menu contains "work/"
 and "play/"... it's sibling directories.


It's not the first thing people expect. Why do it then?

Say that hack's subdirectories are live/ and die/. And that you want to
go to live.


~/  hack/  2>>
           die/
           live/



Hey! you can read that left-to-right!
