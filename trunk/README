Darimasen File Manager - 0.0.6 [Feature Incomplete - Only for Experimental Use]

Readme.txt - 18 Feb. 2005

0.0.6 was released on the policy of, "Hey- I'm going to do some
major breakage. Time for a tarball". This breakage is reimplementing
for tab support, or at least this is what I would like you to believe.

This tarball corresponds with SVN commit 25. There will be no branch, as
this software shoukld not yet be considered stable enough for anything
but seeing where I might be going with it, and even then it is only in a
"works for me" state. If your files get eaten, this is probably a gnome-vfsmm
issue. If they get chmod'ed to the great /dev/null in the sky, don't say you
remained unwarned.

There is no documentation.

There is no support, unless you have the most current SVN checkout (> 25).

That said, I do not regularly get segfaults on tests - though ROX is still
my regular file manager.

Darimasen is based on one main idea: never say 'folder'; at least,
not if you can't actually hold a folder. 

Programming-wise, this means that there are not only folder icons,
but you simply can't navigate the directory structure via the
file view. There is (or will be) a directory tree, but even this is
not displayed by default.

Darimasen has menu-based directory navigation. It might be remind
you of the Gnome 2.8 file chooser's buttons, or of the website
navigation technique - but it has two major differences:

1. They are all menus,

2. Those menus show sibling directories, not child directories.

For example, say you are in your home directory, which 
has three subdirectories; work/, play/, and hack/. Two menus would be
generated; the first, "~/", would switch you between home and
other important areas, like your mounted drives. THe second, in this case,
would be a "3>>"; the current folder has three subdirectories,
and you access them through that menu. And look! "hack/" has a "2"
beside it, meaning it has two subdirectories itself. So clicking
"hack/", the menus change.


~/  hack/  2>>


The "~/" menu is the same, but the new "hack/" menu contains "work/"
 and "play/"... it's sibling directories.


It's not the first thing people expect. Why do it then?

Say that hack's subdirectories are live/ and die/. And that you want to
go to live.


~/  hack/  2>>
           die/
           live/



Hey! you can read that left-to-right!
